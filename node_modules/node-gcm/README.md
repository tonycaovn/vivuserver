# node-gcm

node-gcm is a Node.JS library for [**Google Cloud Messaging for Android**](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/index.html), which replaces Cloud 2 Device Messaging (C2DM).

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install node-gcm
```
##Requirements

An Android device running 2.0 or newer and an API key as per [GCM getting started guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/gs.html).

## Usage

More features, such as multicast-messaging and a sample webserver, will come soon.
```js
var gcm = require('node-gcm');
var registrationId = 'insert yours here'; 


var message = new gcm.Message();
var sender = new gcm.Sender('insert Google Server API Key here');


message.addData('key1','message1');
message.addData('key2','message2');

/**
 * Parameters: Message-literal, registrationId, No. of retries, callback-function
 */
sender.send(message, registrationId, 4, function (result) {
	console.log(result);
});
```

And without retries
```js
sender.sendNoRetry(message, registrationId, function (result) {
	console.log(result);
});
```
